# Credit-EDA
The primary objective of this case study is to illustrate the practical application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a genuine business context. Throughout this case study, we will cultivate a fundamental comprehension of risk analytics within the banking and financial services sector, gaining insights into how data plays a pivotal role in mitigating financial lending risks.

**Business Understanding:**
Lending companies often face challenges when deciding to lend money to people who don't have a strong or any credit history. Some individuals take advantage of this situation by not repaying their loans. To make sure we don't turn down people who can actually repay their loans, we use a method called Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine the data for any patterns.

When our company gets a loan application, we have to make a decision about whether or not to approve the loan based on the applicant's background. There are two types of risks we consider when making this decision: 
1.If the applicant is expected to repay the loan but it's not approved, the company loses potential business.
2.On the other hand, if the applicant is unlikely to repay the loan, meaning there's a high risk of default, approving the loan could lead to financial losses for the company.

The dataset provided includes information about loan applications at the time they were submitted. It encompasses two main scenarios:
1.Clients with payment difficulties: These are individuals who experienced late payments of more than X days on at least one of the first Y installments of the loan in our sample.
2.All other cases: This category includes instances where payments were made on time.

**Business Goals:**
This case study's primary objective is to spot patterns that indicate whether a client might struggle with making loan payments. These patterns can guide actions such as denying a loan, reducing the loan amount, or offering loans to riskier applicants at higher interest rates. The ultimate aim is to make sure that people who can actually repay their loans are not turned away. This case study aims to identify such applicants through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

The company wants to figure out what factors most strongly predict whether someone will default on a loan. This knowledge can be valuable for managing the company's loan portfolio and assessing risks.
